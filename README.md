# leionwebdesign
This project uses HTML and CSS. I got the design from www.graphberry.com, and its name is "Leon." I wrote all the code myself to test my skills in creating a website that looks exactly like the design. I used fonts from Google Fonts, icons from fontawesome.com, and the normalize.css file.
